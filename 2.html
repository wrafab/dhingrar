               3D Designing And Printing
            <br>What will you make?
            
            <br>I made a 3d seal stamp with my initials on it.
            The preview of the file was saved and made in Fusion 360.
            <br>The project involved learning the basic sculpting and modeling functions used in Fusion.The project also involved for us to learn to change extensions of the file to makw it compatible for various softwares using CAD.<br>

            <br>Sizing in the parametric work helped in visualising the real life outcome when printed. 
                <br>The printed file needed to be reoriented in the right direction to save time and space when printed.
            It was a promising Second Week.</h4><br>
