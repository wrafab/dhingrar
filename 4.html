               Press Fit Kit
            <br>A press fit kit is a group of 2d objects that when combined together in the right form end up making a 3d object.
                I made the press fit kit using Fusion and basic tools for measurement.
                 
            
            <br>My press-fit kit was ideally supposed to be more intricate but I ended up making a simplified version of it.
             Specific elements of design were identified and then respectively ratered and cut using the laser cutter.
            <br>The peices could then be put together to form an elongated piramid whose faces were the eiffel tower.<br>

            <br>The Water Bottle
                <br>The cylinders are seemlessly fascinating objects, and my next assignment <br>was engraving on a water bottle in the shape 
                 of a cylinder.<br> This assignment opened a new area of the laser cutter by putting in the use of rollers.
                 <br>The rollers and the rotation played a huge part in this project.<br> The rotation led to the engraving to be on the curved surface 
                 rather than in a straight line.</h4><br>

            <br>The Bookmark<br>
                 I chose to make a metal bookmark.The metal bookmark had the same design requirements<br>
                 as that of any concocted project made in Corel X7.It just showed how the speed, frequency
                 <br>and power had to be varied when using a different medium of print.
