                First Day of class and the design challenge!!
            
            HOW MANY COINS CAN YOU BALANCE?
            <br>The making of a 3d structure with only a few everyday use objects to handle the weight of a bag of coins,
            without touching the surface below it.
            <br>The challenge included using starws, string, cup and some tape.
            <br>The best model was the one that could handle the weight using the property of triangles.Our was the second best model as it could not handle the maximum weight as the strings were not cross-linked.
            <br>NOT THE WINNER NOT THE LOOSER
                <br>Got to earn knowledge this week.
