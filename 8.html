            <br><h4>The Soldering Project
                 There were two choices in the soldering assignment:
                 <br>1.to make a LED heart
                 <br>2.to make an LED spinning wheel<br>
                 I chose the second one and was confident about it.Learning to solder was fun.The specs that we learn about cleaning the knibs before use and using a clean knib so that it oxidizes more was fun.I soldered it and was able to complete the procedure, but the model itself did not function the way it was supposed to.The only conclusion I could think about was that the resistors or the capacitators had been flipped.
