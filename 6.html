            <br><h4>The Notebook
               
            <br> I really like decorating stuff especially with stickers.<br> When I got to know that this was our next assignment I was really excited.
                My noteboook looks simple, but I really like the monochromatic simplicity of it.<br> We had take the size of the notebook and then make stickers that fit in that particular size.After My design was done, I had to export to the vinyl <br> printer to get it cut.
                 The cutting part was easy but weeding the not required elements from the required ones was hard <br> and time consuming. After the weeding was done it was placed on a special type of role that helped it to be applied on <br> the notebook itself.

            The label:This sticker was created so that as any other notebook I could write my name inside of it.
                 <br>The good vibes sticker: This sticker was created so that whenever I feel like writing in this notebook, I write with a smile on my face and good thoughts.
                 
                 <br>The Pattern: This was created because I did not want the front to look empty and boring.

            <br>The Chocolate Mold<br>
                 For the chocolate mold I used my 3D OBJECT-"the cupcake" to be milled out of the wax. After the mold is put into it, I will be attaching more pictures.

            <br>Molding A Coaster<br>
                 For this assignment we were given an empty container, in which we had to put the thoroughly mixed urethane and expoxy.<br>
                 we also had to put an object inside the coaster; My object was a piece of gem which had fallen apart from my hairclip.
